    "* The primary objective of this project is to identify the key factors impacting performance ratings. These influential features were determined using machine learning model feature importance techniques. Preprocessing involved utilizing the Label Encoding method to convert categorical data into numerical format, as most machine learning algorithms require numerical input. The project successfully achieved its goals through the application of machine learning models and visualization techniques. "

    "1. The majority of employees in the **Sales department** achieve level 3 performance ratings, with males slightly outperforming females, while work experience shows minimal impact on performance.\n",
    "2. Most employees in **Human Resources** attain level 3 performance ratings, with older employees performing less effectively, although female employees excel, and work experience significantly influences performance.\n",
    "3. The **Development department** sees a large number of employees achieving level 3 performance across all age groups, with a balanced performance distribution between genders. \n",
    "4. **Data Science** records the highest average of level 3 performance, with fewer employees at level 2, and age having little impact on performance, while males tend to perform well, and work experience is influential.\n",
    "   \n",
    "5. Age does not significantly influence performance in the **Research & Development department**, which showcases strong female performers. \n",
